This extension uses semantic highlighting.  Here is an example:

<img src="applesoft-highlights.png" alt="screenshot with extension highlights" width="600"/>

Contrast with Visual BASIC highlights of the same file:

<img src="default-highlights.png" alt="screenshot with default highlights" width="600"/>
